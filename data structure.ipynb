    "#Why might you choose a deque from the collections module to implement a queue instead of using a \n",
    "\n",
    " #regular Python list?\n",
    "\"\"\"choosing a deque from the collections module over a regular Python list to implement a queue offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Efficient Operations: The deque (double-ended queue) is optimized for fast operations on both ends of the queue. Appending and popping items from both ends (left and right) of a deque are very efficient operations, typically O(1) time complexity. In contrast, while Python lists can perform these operations, they may not be as efficient especially for operations at the beginning of the list (list.pop(0) for dequeueing), which can be O(n) due to the need to shift all other elements.\n",
    "2.Thread Safety: If your application involves concurrent access from multiple threads, deque is designed to be thread-safe. It provides atomic operations like append, popleft, appendleft, etc., which can be important in multithreaded environments to avoid race conditions and data corruption.\n",
    "3.Memory Efficiency: While list in Python can dynamically resize itself and allocate more memory as needed, a deque may use memory more efficiently for specific types of operations, especially when dealing with a large number of elements and frequent manipulations at both ends of the queue.\n",
    "4.Clearer Intent: Using a deque communicates your intent more clearly to other developers. When you use a deque to implement a queue, it signifies that you're interested in queue-like behavior (FIFO - First-In-First-Out) rather than general list operations. This can make your code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "5.Additional Methods: deque provides additional methods specific to deque operations, such as rotate, extendleft, and clear, which can be useful depending on the requirements for queue implementation\"\"\"\n",
